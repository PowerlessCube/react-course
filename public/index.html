Webpack
1. It allows us to organise our javascript files, webpack takes all of our dependencies 
and returns one big zepplin file back.  Gulp and others has been doing it for years
but webpack breaks up all of our javascript and allows them to communicate with eachother.

e.g. grab the add function from the add.js file in the utils folder.

2. It allows you to grab depencies to use within your app.

e.g. grab React from the npm module

// split it into public/ src/ mode_modules/
